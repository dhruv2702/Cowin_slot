Build a slot checker application on python that will update the user if the vaccine slots are available in their area.APIs are used from https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin#/
It will check in every 5s. If the slots are available it will show the information about the center and will automatically open the cowin login page on the web browser.
